# Modding Instructions
If You Want To Mod Friday Night Funkin', Here Are The Instructions :
First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple)

1. [Install Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Download 4.1.5 instead of 4.2.0 because 4.2.0 is broken and is not working with gits properly...)

2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe

Other installations you'd need is the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:
```
flixel
flixel-addons
flixel-ui
hscript
```

So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install flixel`

You'll also need to install a couple things that involve Gits. To do this, you need to do a few things first.

1. Download [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Works for Windows, Mac, and Linux, just select your build.

2. Follow instructions to install the application properly.

3. Run `haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git` to install Polymod.

4. Run `haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc` to install Discord RPC.

At the moment, you can optionally fix some bugs regarding the engine:

1. A transition bug in songs with zoomed out cameras

- Run `haxelib git flixel-addons https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/flixel-addons` in the terminal/command-prompt.

2. A text rendering bug (mainly noticeable in the story menu under tracks)

- Run `haxelib git openfl https://github.com/openfl/openfl` in the terminal/command-prompt.
